"""
This module demonstrates the use of variable annotations in Python.

The module defines four variables with their types explicitly annotated:
    - `a`: An integer.
    - `pi`: A floating-point number representing the value of π (pi).
    - `i_understand_annotations`: A boolean indicating whether the user
    understands annotations.
    - `school`: A string representing the name of a school.

Variables:
    - a (int): An integer value.
    - pi (float): A floating-point value representing π.
    - i_understand_annotations (bool): A boolean indicating
    understanding of annotations.
    - school (str): A string representing the name of the school
    ("Holberton").
